In this we just need to check if we can give correct change to every customer.
The basic idea is that we keep track of how many 5s and 10s we have.

If the customer pays with 5, we don't return anything.

If the customer pays with 10, we give one 5.

If the customer pays with 20, we try to give one 10 and one 5, otherwise three 5.

If we cannot give any of the above possibility then we just failed.

"Time Complexity"
We only traverse once so time complexity will be O(n).
