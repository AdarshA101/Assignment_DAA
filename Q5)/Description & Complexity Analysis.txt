In this we just need to flatten a linked list.
In this each node has next and child pointers.
The basic idea is we go through each list using the next pointer.
Then we just move child pointer and store each element in a ArrayList then after encountering null we make head = head.next to move forward then repeat the same function till we got the last element entered in the list. Then we just sort it then we call a function to make linked list from the given arraylist and then just print the flattened linkedlist.

"Time Complexity"
We move each node in x and y direction so in x let it be 'n' and in y dirction let it be 'y' and we make sorting so it would be 
O(xlog(x)) where x = (n*m).
