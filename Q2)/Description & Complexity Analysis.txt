In this we just need to check if any element comes more than n/2 times in the array.
The basic idea is that if one element is majority, then even if we cancel it with all different elements, it will still be there at the end.
So first we find that element as a candidate while going through the array.
Then we again count how many times it come to confirm if it is more than n/2.
If yes, that is the majority element. Otherwise, no majority element is there.

"Time Complexity"
We only go through the array two times, so the time complexity is O(n).
