In this we just need to find the longest subsequence of consecutive numbers in an array.
The basic idea is we sort the array so that all numbers come in increasing order
Now we use two list list1 to keep track of the current consecutive subsequence list2 to store the longest subsequence till now.
now:
If the current element is the same as the previous one, we skip it and If the current element is exactly 1 greater than the previous, it continues the subsequence, so we add it to list1 else the consecutive sequence breaks, so we clear list1 and start a new subsequence with the current element.
After each step, if list1 is longer than list2, we update list2 with the contents of list1.

"Time Complexity"
The array is sorted so it is in O(nlogn).Therefore the timecomplexity is O(nlogn).
