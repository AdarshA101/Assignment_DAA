In this we just need to delete the nth node from the end of a linked list.
The basic idea is that we first count how many nodes are in the list.
Then we calculate the position of the node to delete from the start as length - n.

If it is the first node, we move the head to the next node.

Otherwise, we go to the node just before the one to delete and change its next pointer to skip the target node.
This removes the required node from the list.

"Time Complexity"
We just need to traverse the nodes, Therefore Time Complexity will be O(n).
