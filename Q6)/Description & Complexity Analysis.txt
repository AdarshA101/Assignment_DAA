In this we just need to check how many trains are present at the station at the same time.
The basic idea is that for every train arrival, we count how many trains have not yet left.
If arrival time of one train lies between arrival and departure of another train, it means both are at the station at the same time, so we need one more platform.
Therefore we check for the maximum platforms needed at any instance of time.

"Time Complexity"
We check every train with all other trains, so the time complexity is O(nÂ²).
